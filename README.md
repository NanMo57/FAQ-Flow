ðŸš€ FAQ Flow - interactive FAQ and collapsible answers
This project features an interactive FAQ section with collapsible answers and a responsive navigation menu. Built with vanilla JavaScript.

âœ¨ Features:

Hamburger Menu Toggle â€“ Displays the navigation menu when the hamburger icon (.fa-bars) is clicked and hides it with the close icon (.fa-xmark).
Collapsible FAQ Section â€“ Each FAQ question can expand or collapse to reveal its answer. Icons toggle between fa-plus and fa-minus to control this behavior.
Smooth Transitions â€“ Transitions are handled with JavaScript to smoothly toggle visibility without page reloads.
